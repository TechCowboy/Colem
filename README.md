This is based on ColEm 5.6, that was  published on March 3 2021, makes most command line options work on Windows and adds optional frame rate display. The previous release also added the "Hardware | Paste Clipboard" option to ColEm-Windows, when running in Coleco Adam mode. This option allows pasting Windows clipboard contents directly into Adam software.
